**Region:** I chose to look at Boise County in Idaho because I might live there in my late 20s so I want to understand
the cost of living there better.

**Datasets:**
I chose median household income and minimum wage in Idaho to show what people are earning to Idaho and how the minimum 
wage might interact with it. I chose median listing price of houses in Idaho as my capital expense for a typical person
or family. For another capital expense, I looked at tuition to Boise State University because it is the largest school in
Idaho. For small regular expenses I pulled in data on ground beef, natural gas (for heating homes) and also general
electricity prices. The ground beef data set is for the West Region of the U.S. which includes Idaho, state level price
data of specific goods was not readily available.

**Strategies:**
I will use consistent color on both of my graphs and use line graphs since I am dealing with data over time. I will minimize
visual load by reducing clutter whenever I can (the use of tabs also helps with this). When the user scrolls down slightly
all that is visible are the two graphs, tab selection, and input fields. The y-axis on the graphs will start at zero.

**Example Scenarios:**
1. The cost of tuition is rising fast that income is rising, so education is becoming less affordable.
2. Low cost items like beef and energy rose much less than income, so basic necessities are becoming more affordable.
3. Housing has increased much faster than income, Idaho follows other national trends of housing becoming more expensive.


**Feedback Update:** I recieved feedback from my classmates and Mike that my graphs should show only the same years
to have a more accurate comparison. I went back, cleaned my data and now the graphs only show comparisons across consistent
timelines.
