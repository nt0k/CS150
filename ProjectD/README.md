**Description:** Using an Axios article titled "Border Patrol apprehensions on 
U.S.-Mexico border" written by Avery Lotz and Stef Knight, I was tasked with telling 
an intentionally misleading story with data. 

**Thesis:** Trump inherited Bidenâ€™s progress and normal cycles of border apprehensions.

**Datasets:** All my data was sourced directly from the US Border Patrol. I 
combined two datasets from them to get FY21-FY25 (through February) data on
encounters at the Southern Border. I parsed a PDF to obtain historical data
going back to FY2000 on apprehensions at the southern border.

**Strategies Used to Mislead:** I carefully restricted what years were able to my viewed
in my graphs to make it look like the numbers weren't that much higher under Biden
and that both him and Trump had both previously experienced similar lows. I also added
a pie chart to show how a COVID era law is no longer used as a means to distract from
the fact that Biden's numbers were much higher than Trump's. I also used the pie charts
to increase the cognitive load on the user to try and ensure that they don't percieve my misleading
story too quickly.
