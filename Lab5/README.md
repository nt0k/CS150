I downloaded the Credit card Details Binary Classification Problem
dataset off of Kaggle. The author is Rohit Udageri, and the url is:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details/data?select=Credit_card.csv

This dataset contains 17 columns of data and a label of 1 or 0 corresponding
to a credit card application being accepted or denied. Some of the columns
are very relevant to be able to use a credit card well (annual income) while
others like phone number aren't relevant at all.
