**Thesis**: Idaho has great air quality across all measures.

**Context**: I am thinking about moving to Idaho one day, I am drawn to it because of its 
natural beauty, low cost of living, and conservative political values. Because of its high 
amount of green space and low population density, its air quality tends to be far above
average for states in the U.S. The station that I got my air quality data from is 
in Boise county which has 1 million people in it, a sizable urban area. Yet, it has very good
air quality. 

**Data**: I pulled data for 5 pollutants: CO, NO2, Ozone, PM 2.5, and SO2 from 2023 from the Meridian - St. Luke's
site. Data was not available from the same site for Pb or PM 10. 

**Visualization Strategies**: I will employ practices I have learned from Storytelling with Data
such as eliminating clutter, utilizing whitespace, and employing thoughtful use of color to make my 
visualizations effective.
