**Thesis**: Idaho has great air quality across all measures.

**Context**: I am thinking about moving to Idaho one day, I am drawn to it because of its 
natural beauty, low cost of living, and conservative political values. Because of its high 
amount of green space and low population density, its air quality tends to be far above
average for states in the U.S. The station that I got my air quality data from is 
in Boise county which has 1 million people in it, a sizable urban area. Yet, it has very good
air quality. My data will be presented to my classmates and also my teacher Mike. They have a
basic understanding of air quality because of working on projects themselves. The key takeaway
I want my audience to have is that Idaho has great air quality and it could be a great place
to live or vacation one day because of that. I will convey this message through a line chart
visualization and plain text to explain how it compares to the US national average. My tone will 
be professional as this will be presented in a classroom setting. 

**Data**: I pulled data for 5 pollutants: CO, NO2, Ozone, PM 2.5, and SO2 from 2023 from the Meridian - St. Luke's
site. Data was not available from the same site for Pb or PM 10. I obtained this data from the EPA.

**Visualization Strategies**: I will employ practices I have learned from Storytelling with Data
such as eliminating clutter, utilizing whitespace, and employing consistent use of color to make my 
visualizations effective.
