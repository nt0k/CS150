**Thesis**: Asia has developed significantly in the last two decades increasing electricity
availability and life expectancy while only moderately increasing its per capita emissions.

**Context**: Who, what, how. My audience is my classmates and teacher. They have some familiarity
with world bank data as they have done research in preparation for this project. I will convey 
an optimistic message about Asia's development and environmental impacts. The takeaway that I want
my audience to have is that Asia is improving like the rest of the world, and more humans are flourishing
even if the rate of growth is slower than other places. I will reinforce this by showing that per capita
emissions have not dramatically increased and forest area is stable, even though renewable energy is not
the dominate source of energy in Asia. 

**Data**: I pulled the following data from the world bank: Total greenhouse gas emissions excluding LULUCF per capita,
Forest area (% of land area), Access to electricity (% of population), and Life expectancy at birth, total (years).

**Visualization Strategies**: I will use a choropleth graph to visualize changes in the region of Asia.
