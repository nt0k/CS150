**Thesis**: Asia has developed significantly in the last two decades increasing electricity
availability and life expectancy while only moderately increasing its per capita emissions.

**Context**: Who, what, how. My audience is my classmates and teacher. They have some familiarity
with world bank data as they have done research in preparation for this project. I will convey 
an optimistic message about Asia's development and environmental impacts. The takeaway that I want
my audience to have is that Asia is improving like the rest of the world, and more humans are flourishing. Several countries
have increased their electricity availability and life expectancy, while forest area has remained stable and per capita
emissions have increased slightly.

**Data**: I pulled the following data from the world bank: Total greenhouse gas emissions excluding LULUCF per capita,
Forest area (% of land area), Access to electricity (% of population), and Life expectancy at birth, total (years).

**Visualization Strategies**: I will use a choropleth graph to visualize changes in the region of Asia with several
options for interactivity. The years can be changed manually, advanced one at a time with a button, or a continuous animation
can be toggled with another button. For a closer look, each country will be able to be clicked on to display how its
life expectancy has changed over the last two decades.
